Floods are the most common disaster in Malaysia, as the country is affected by seasonal monsoon floods (the most dangerous), flash floods, and tidal floods. Flood disasters have had serious consequences for people, hurting livelihoods, destroying property and infrastructure, and taking lives. Thus, in order to combat this disaster within disaster, we propose limiting the capacity of the emergency shelter in order to adhere to the new guidelines for preventing the spread of covid-19.
